# 50 ⭐ Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

## Completion

All 50 problems completed and all 50 ⭐'s achieved.

Some problems use slower methods but none of them run for more than a minute on my PC, and most days are basically instant.

## How to run

To run a specific day use `cargo run -- dd-p`

For example to run day 3 part 2 use `cargo run -- 03-2`

The days 14-2, 17-1, 17-2, 22-2, 23-2 are somewhat slower (slowest is 23-2 is 30 secs+). So consider using release mode with `cargo run -- dd-p --release`.

Alternatively to run all parts use `cargo run -- all --release`
